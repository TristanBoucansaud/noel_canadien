      <a href="https://adaptiv.systems/" target="_blank"><h2>Adaptiv Systems</h2></a><h2 class='no-margin'>&nbsp(first project in Centrale Digital Lab)</h2>
      <h3>September - November 2021</h3>
      <p class='indent'>Adaptiv Systems is a start-up that finds solutions to create tailored IoT systems for companies. Their aim is to help these companies
        in their object-driven digitalisation. We developed a website from scratch with two other students, improving my skills in HTML, CSS and Javascript for the frontend.
        We used Node.js in backend, an environment I had to learn.</p>
      <a href="http://www.exelis.com/" target="_blank"><h2>Exelis</h2></a><h2 class='no-margin'>&nbsp(traineeship)</h2>
      <h3>April - August 2021</h3>
      <p class='indent'>Exelis is a very small enterprise, specialized in IT services. I worked on a website called "mon-event",
        which is used to manage an event from scratch to hatch. Thanks to this traineeship, I learnt to develop a website,
        by using HTML, CSS and Javascript for the frontend and PHP for the backend. I also worked with another intern,
        so I learnt how to use GitHub.</p>
      <h2>Member of the adminitration board of the Ecole Centrale de Lyon</h2>
      <h3>2021 - 2023</h3>
      <p class="indent">Elected in March 2021, I am a member of the adminitration board of my school. Our aim is to rule the school,
        vote for important decisions proposed by different protagonists like the school director, the study board or students. Every decision
        that involve an expenditure for example must be examined by the council. I also take part on the disciplinary board. This experience
        showed me how a big infrastructure works, and the importance of each decision they take.</p>

        especially consulting, which are executed by students, aiming at giving practical experience to them in their field of studying.
        Centrale Lyon Conseil is the Junior-Enterprise of the Ecole Centrale de Lyon, where I belonged during a year, as a Study Manager.
        I used to be the link between the student and the client, in order to lead the study, organise the communication and manage
        both the planning and the cost of the study.</p>

      <h3>2019 - 2023</h3>
      <p class='indent'>The Ecole Centrale de Lyon is the 7th best french engineering school,
        it is based on multidisciplinary teaching, in order to train our versatility.
        We also specialize in some particular fields, which are computering science and management for me.
        I especially followed general lessons on Python, Java and C++, and lessons on management and about Humanities and Social Sciences. </p>

      <p class="indent">A preparatory class for the grandes écoles (CPGE) is a 2-year curriculum that leads to entrance exams for the grandes écoles.
        We learn a lot of maths and physics, in order to obtain a solid scientific basis. I did mine in 3 years, to optimise my odds for the entrance exams.
        Not useful in terms of hard skills, these years made me more rigorous and painstaking.</p>

      <h1>Interests</h1>
      <h2>Judo and sports</h2>
      <p class="indent">I am black belt and immersed in Judo’s values since my childhood. These values are ruled by the Moral Code of Judo,
      which is composed of 8 values : respect, courage, self control, sincerity, politeness, modesty, friendship and honor.</p>
      <h2>Computers</h2>
      <p class="indent">I like coding, playing and tickle the limits of computers. I like working on personnal projects like this website.
      I also used to be a competitive player of Teamfight Tactics, a strategy video game where I reached the top 500th in Europe.</p>
      <h2>Philosophy</h2>
      <p class="indent">I am interested in Philosophy and I read a lot of ancient books. Understanding how the greatest thinkers used to see
      their world, their society and their feelings is in my opinion a key to understand our modern world in a different way. Plato, Descartes
     or Euler are ones of my favourites.</p>
